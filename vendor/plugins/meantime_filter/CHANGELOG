= v0.1.2
* Previous versions used Method#call when filters were registered with Symbols
  as controller method name which modified the safe level (thanks to Lee Jensen
  for reporting this). This has been changed to both not modify the safe level
  anymore and be faster simply using "send".

= v0.1.1
* Added aliases for +meantime_filter+: +wrap_filter+ and +wrap_actions+. Those
  filters can now be registered with:
  * wrap_actions
  * append_wrap_actions
  * prepend_wrap_actions
  And:
  * wrap_filter
  * append_wrap_filter
  * prepend_wrap_filter
  They are indeed more appropriate to the goal of those "yielding" filters.
  Thanks to Ezra Zygmuntowicz for the justified proposals of aliases.
